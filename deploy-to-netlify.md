## 🔧 Configuration Files

The following files have been created for optimal Netlify deployment:

### `netlify.toml`
- Build configuration
- Redirect rules for SPA routing
- Security headers
- Caching rules

### `_redirects`
- Fallback for client-side routing
- Ensures all routes work properly

## 🌐 Environment Variables (if needed)

If you need environment variables:

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Environment variables
3. Add any required variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_VERSION`
   - etc.

## 📁 Project Structure for Deployment

## 🚀 Post-Deployment

After deployment, you can:

1. **Custom Domain**: Add your own domain in Site settings
2. **HTTPS**: Automatically enabled by Netlify
3. **Analytics**: Enable Netlify Analytics
4. **Forms**: Use Netlify Forms for contact forms
5. **Functions**: Add serverless functions if needed

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

With Git integration, every push to your main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

The app includes:
- ✅ Lazy loading of components
- ✅ Optimized images
- ✅ Proper caching headers
- ✅ Gzip compression (automatic)
- ✅ CDN distribution (automatic)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 on refresh**: Ensure `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
2. **Build fails**: Check Node version (should be 18+)
3. **Assets not loading**: Verify asset paths are correct
4. **Routing issues**: Check `netlify.toml` redirect rules

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test build locally
npx serve -s build
```

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The app is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Mobile devices
